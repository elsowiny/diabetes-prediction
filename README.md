<p><em>Abstract</em> - Diabetes is a major global health issue, affecting millions of people worldwide. 
Early prediction of diabetes can help in effective management and treatment, leading to improved patient outcomes.
In this study, I compared three machine learning models, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Trees (DT), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), for diabetes prediction using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The dataset was preprocessed, including normalizing the data, and splitting into training and testing sets.
The models were trained on the training set, and their performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
The SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 74.89%, followed by the ANN model with 74.03% accuracy, and the DT model with 70.56% accuracy.
Model optimization was performed using hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, which improved model performance.
The study also analyzed feature importance and visualizations to better understand the data and the performance of the models.</p>
